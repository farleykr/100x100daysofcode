# 100 x 100 Days of Code

### GOAL:
To write Python code for one-hundred consecutive days.  On the first day I'll write one line of code.  On the second day I'll write two.  And so on and so forth.  Each day will have its own `.py` file.  Code comments don't count.  I might skip weekends here and there, picking up where I left off on the following Monday.
